## Data Types

In GoLang, data types specify the type of data a variable can hold. They are divided into the following categories:

- Basic Types: These include numbers (integers, floating point, complex), strings, and booleans.
- Aggregate Types: These include arrays and structs.
- Reference Types: These include pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels.
- Interface Types: These are abstract types that specify a method set.
